## Introduction

[_This section provides an overview of this documents purpose._]

[New World](https://newworld.com/) is an MMO by game developer Amazon Game Studios (AGS).
New World has an active and passionate community focused on speed running content.
Speed running by its nature is fast evolving; regularly introducing new objectives, restrictions and strategies.
The following rules are intended to present clear guidelines for the submission and recognition of speed running records, as well as maintaining the integrity of the speed running community.

This document and its content are defined and maintained by the New World speed running committee ("the committee"). The committee must have no less than [3] and no more than [?] members. The committee may add or remove committee members via a [large majority (>75%)] vote. Changes to this document must be approved by the committee via a [large majority (>75%)] vote. Initial formation of the committee will be conducted via a nomination process. [The nomination process is TBD.]

## Tools

A tool is a piece of hardware or software that is able to replace or augment the actions of a player.
Tools can be used to enable the player to perform actions that they otherwise could not normally perform, or perform actions with greater consistency or efficacy, which can result in faster speed runs.

## Exploits

An exploit is a game bug or feature that when utilised grants an unintended benefit to a player.
Exploits can be used to ease or skip otherwise necessary time consuming actions which can result in faster speed runs.
All exploits identified by AGS are automatically regarded as exploits by these rules.

[^1]: The lack of restrictions should not be considered an endorsement of violating the New World terms of service.
